    <h3>Margin, Borders, and Padding with Castles</h3>
    <h5>15 FEB 15</h5>
      <p>
      Alright, one important aspect of spacing in CSS is understanding the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding.  These are all related to the 'box' of an object,how much space it takes up, and how things inside will be placed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Margin: The margin of an element is the distance outside that the element 'takes up'.  If you give a box a margin of 10px, then you are telling other objects that there is an extra 10px off of the border that is being used by the object.  Like an invisible force shield extending 10px off, that will prevent anything else (well, that can be bypassed) from getting closer. 
       margin (top, right, left, bottom): 10px;
       </p>
       <p>
      Border: The border is the last physical boundary. A border is set, and that determines the limits of an element.  It would be the outer walls of a building.  It's set, it's there, you can choose to display it. 
      border(top, right, bottom, left): 10px;
      </p>
      <p>

      Padding: The inner part of the border that determines how far away from the border, the items inside will actually be.  Set this to 10px and whatever is inside will have 10px of space between it and the border.
      padding (top, right, left, bottom): 10px;
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>Let's try this...</p>
      <p>
      Padding is the King inside the castle, sitting in his room.  Not moving, having every joy in the world.  The border is the Castle's outer walls; all that awesome stone.  The margin is the last farmland that belongs to the king before it turns into the evil kings' land...there is no real boundary line, but the evil king won't cross that land.
      </p>

      ^That helped me.

    <h3> Git Blogg'n</h3>
    <h5>08 FEB 15</h5>
   		<p>  These blogs will definitely be getting longer as more advanced topics come around.  Right now, this is just a simple overview of a few tools we will be using throughout our course.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	I will try to go in order here.  Basic command line commands is where it all started.  Simple navigation, creating/removing, copying/moving various items (directories and files).  The commands are pretty straight forward.  All it takes is using them over and over to really get everything down and memorized.  The only issue I have had is when moving/copying I sometimes cant find my file in the designated directory but when I go to delete the directory it says that it is not empty (though it appears empty).  I somehow make random Ghost Files that I can't see, but appear to exist when trying to rmdir (remove directory).
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	Next up, version control Git.  Version control is a wonderful idea.  It is probably the most important tool that we, as aspiring developers, have on our computers.  Version control allows all of our changes to be tracked and logged for reference.  As someone who likes to try out many approaches/solutions, this will make finding the best/most efficient one so much easier.  I can compare my 'old' code directly with changes I wish to implement and see if it is worth keeping.  Git logs all changes (that are added) so looking at previous/new code is super convenient.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	Now in order to make everything accessible remotely or to anyone else, it is all pushed to GitHub.  GitHub is basically the cloud for all code (and other files) we will be working on.  Loading everything to GitHub gives someone else access to my code and changes, and allows me to access my code from a different computer if needed and 'sync' it all together.  I am completely new to GitHub (well everything so far, really) so I still am getting used to the layout and navigation.  As far as I can tell, I have not had much trouble with using GitHub.  Pretty much push/pull to and from GitHub and everything should be up to date on both ends.

    <h3>Chef's Kitchen</h3>
    <h5>08 FEB 15</h5>
      <p>
      As of right now, I have the impression that the DBC experience will be well balanced with hard, challenging, and even stressful work, and constant satisfaction with the improvements and knowledge that will be gained.  To me, that makes for a rewarding experience when everything is all said and done (well, I will never be 'done' with any of this... just my time at DBC).  I am looking forward to the challenges and complete change of pace from my 'usual' routine in life.  I'm already seeing how much dedication will be needed to succeed and have already made some changes in my personal time to make sure I am going in a full 100 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have already enjoyed just a few minutes of chat with various people in DBC and am excited to be going through DBC with everyone.  There are definitely going to be different approaches by everyone based off past experiences and career choices.  I find that fascinating and extremely helpful.  Engaging with people at DBC shouldn't be an issue at all.  Even with those who have no prior programming experience, I am looking forward to learning as much as I can from everyone.  I have always liked the culture and outcomes from this culture, I just have never been apart of it.
    </p>
    <p>
       This learning environment definitely has me both excited and nervous.  I like the environment of learning by hands on and daily engagements.  I guess the nervous part would be with the pace.  I just keep thinking that when it picks up, and more advanced topics are learned, if I don't understand something I will immediately start to fall behind.  But then that brings me back to the culture because I have already noticed how helpful people have been just in the first week of the course.  Others have already posted issues and someone has responded with a suggestion or solution almost immediately.  I just hope I will be able to give as much I am receiving from everyone else.
