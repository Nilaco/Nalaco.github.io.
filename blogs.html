      <p>
        A variables scope is where that variable will be accessible within a program.  By setting the scope of a variable, it can be accessed from other areas or levels in code.  There are several different variable scopes with Ruby: Global, Constant, Class, Instance, Local.
      </p>

      <p>
        A global variable is distinguished by a $ in front: $global.  Globals are set in order to have access to the variable anywhere in a program.  Using a global variable is risky, as it can be altered from anywhere as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Constant variables begin with a capital letter and after they are given a value, should not be altered.  Constants are accessible anywhere within a class.  If a constant is declared outside of a class, it has the same scope as a global variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class variables are declared by using @@ in front of the name.  These variables are declared in a class, and then are accessible by any instance of that class.  The class variable can be changed in other instances, and effects all instances of the class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instance variables are pretty similar to class variables.  Declared with a single @, instance variables are unique to their specific instance  of a class.  Changes are not spread amongst all instances of a class
      </p>

      <p>
      The most basic, local variables.  Local variables are assigned without anything in front of them.  Accessible only within the code where they rest.  If a local variable is declared within a loop, that is the only place it can be accessed.

    <h3>StereoType Threat</h3> <!--title -->
    <h5>Cultural Blog</h5> <!--subtitle -->
    <h5>15MAR15</h5> <!-- date -->

      <p>
        What is Stereotype Threat? It's when someone's behavior alters because of negative stereotypes from those around.  Basically, you subconsciously fulfill stereotypes because of what is 'expected.' If you ever were embarrassed or ashamed to do something just because of how others would perceive it, you have experienced stereotype threat.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can see based off the various studies (Supplied by a simple Google search,) how stereotype threat affects individuals.  It can significantly affect someones performance.  Not doing something for fear of being judged by another should never be an excuse, regardless of if you are subconsciously avoiding it.  Stereotypes are just that, stereotypes, but unfortunately they still hit individuals with force.
      </p>

      <p>
      I cannot recall any moments where I have felt a stereotype threat nor can I recall a time where I noticed or felt someone else was experiencing this.  It's as simple as not judging people before knowing them, and not judging yourself because of others.  Rather than comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to you X years ago.  Problem solved. Judge yourself based on progression rather than the thoughts of others.  With that, you won't alter your behavior due to others' perceptions.

    <h3>Pairing is Caring</h3> <!--title -->
    <h5>Cultural Blog</h5> <!--subtitle -->
    <h5>08MAR15</h5> <!-- date -->

      <p> Alright, how many people used that same title?</p>

      <p>
        So far all of my pair sessions have been great.  I always benefit from each partner and finish with useful ideas for individual coding.  Pairing is always fun and that really makes learning easier and rewarding.  It's nice to have someone either struggle with you or be able to help out instantly.  
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the best parts about pairing is the feedback that is then received afterwards.  The feedback I have received has been extremely helpful and I have been keeping note of it during other pairings.  It's definitely nice to know how others feel about the session.
      </p>

      <p>
        When giving feedback, the hardest thing for me is to find something I feel the other person needs to improve on.  Everyone has a different style, and it may work wonderfully for them and several other pairs, but maybe not so well with just one other individual.  So it's hard to determine if it was your pair doing something, or yourself that is just not used to that way/style.

    <h3>Go to Class</h3> <!--title -->
    <h5>Technical Blog"</h5> <!--subtitle -->
    <h5>08MAR15</h5> <!-- date -->

      <p>
        The basis of object-oriented programming is the use of classes.  A class is the outer shell that is used to then create individual objects.  Think of a class as the basic definition of a car.  Someone says "car", and some values automatically become associated with it.  Wheels, Doors, Seats, Transmission, Windows...etc.  Though, inside of the "car" class, you can still define the specifics (White, 4 Seats, 4 Doors, Automatic).
      </p>

      <p>
        So when would a class be useful? Whenever you want to make multiple versions of something.  Instead of having to redefine every single aspect of an object, you can use the class to cover the basics and get the rest all set up.  It simplifies the object creation process, and allows values across all instances of a class (instances being an object created from the class).
      </p>

      <p>
        To use a class, you first define a class using "class NAME".  Then everything inside that class will be associated to the class and every object created from it. Just like methods, after you def the class you can then start adding more code blocks, setting variables, and doing whatever else you would ever like to do in your code.  I will set up a car class below, and leave some variables open to be specific when creating a new object.
      </p>

      <p class="code">
        class Car <br>
          attr_accessor :make, :seats, :wheels, :price <br><br>

          def display <br>
            puts @make <br>
            puts @seats <br>
            puts @wheels <br>
            puts @price <br>
          end <br><br>

        end <br><br>

        car = Car.new <br>
        car.make = "CoolCars" <br>
        car.price = 50000 <br>
        car.seats = 4 <br><br>

        car.display <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Above I created a class "Car", and assigned three variables. I used attr_accessor to make each variable to be both readable and writable in the code by using '@variable' anywhere within the class.  I then defined a method inside the class that when called, displays the value set for each variable.  Then, we create a new object from the class "Car", and assign values to each variable, and finally call the 'display' method for the specific object.

    <h3>Travel .maps</h3> <!--title -->
    <h5>Technical Blog</h5> <!--subtitle -->
    <h5>01 MAR 15</h5> <!-- date -->

      <p>
        Useful Tip of the Day: Don't call a sailor's chart a "map".
      </p>

      <p>
        So what is a .map, in Ruby? It is an Enumerable method.  Which means that it is something that is usable on data structures in order to apply code to do various things to the elements within said data structure.  Map is used to apply a code block to each element and return an array with the applied code.  It's easier to understand with an example.
      </p>

      <p> There is a family of 4 traveling to Iowa to visit their cousin, but in order to be seated next to each other on the plane, their last names must to be added to the system </p>

      <p class="code"> family = ["gomez", "morticia", "pugsley", "wednesday"] <br>
                        family.map do |member| <br>
                          member.capitalize! <br>
                          member << " Addams" <br>
                        end
      </p>

      <p> 
        Above, there is an array of names. The array then has .map called on it with 2 lines of code.  For each element in the array, those 2 lines of code are applied.  This results in the output array of:
      </p>

      <p class="code"> # =>["Gomez Addams", "Morticia Addams", "Pugsley Addams", "Wednesday Addams"] </p>

      <p>
        .map is extremely useful for adding or modifying each element in an array.  It is very simple and effective to use on data structures without needed to code a method to iterate each element separately.
      </p>

    <h3>Technological Dependence</h3> <!--title -->
    <h5>Cultural Blog</h5> <!--subtitle -->
    <h5>01 March 15</h5> <!-- date -->

      <p>
        Rather than focusing on a problem IN the Tech World, I decided to focus on a problem caused BY the Tech World.
      </p>

        <p>
          Relying on technology to do basic tasks is taking away from our fundamental skills.  Every day, something is becoming easier to access or do, and with that, human skills start to deteriorate.
        </p>

        <p> 
          Social interactions become more apparent and awkward because you can no longer keep your head down and play your favorite mobile game or message with your "real" friends.  People feel disconnected from others without technology, rather than feeling connected to the immediate world in which they are presently active in.  Communicating with other people is a basic human skill which is slowly slipping away.  Interacting with people you aren't acquainted to is now frowned upon as annoyance (even just sitting next to someone on public transportation is becoming "awkward"). I have had countless times where, either waiting for an appointment or being one of 2 people at,say,  a park, where I have tried to have a face to face conversation with someone I don't know and they just keep going back to their device to play that game or update their social media status. Even with people I frequently interact with, I find it extremely disconnecting (and rude) to be attached to a device while out enjoying each others company.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not just immediate (presence) communication between others is being effected by technology. Less and less people can read a .map/use simple navigation (yep, just referenced this weeks tech blog--anyone else pull that off?), memorize basic information, or even do simple math.  One device can easily do all of those for us.  That may be super convenient (and it is), but for the moments where that little tech gadget is unaccessible, people become lost.  What happens when your lost? You become frightened and unfamiliar with everything around you.
         </p>

        <p>
          So what about all this?  Why should you care about someone who is not in your "friends" group? I can't answer that for anyone.  You choose how you want to deal with people, but if someone is reaching out in the now unconventional way of random social communication, what do you lose by entertaining a friendly interaction for a few moments before deciding to tune out everything around you.  If there is too much of a dependence on technology, people lose dependence for one another.

    <h3>Learning to Think?</h3> <!--title -->
    <h5>Cultural Blog</h5> <!--subtitle -->
    <h5>22 FEB 15</h5> <!-- date -->

      <p>
      Based off the Gregorc Thinking Style Quiz, I am a Concrete Sequential Thinker.  I learn best from starting at the bottom, and getting comfortable with every step before moving on to the next one.  There has to be some format, or order, for me to look back on to really see my own progress.  Though I tend to give in to unstructured learning quite a bit because of the 'new' factor.  I like to learn by doing, and having hands-on at the same moment in order to better understand what parts I am still not getting.
      </p>

      <p>
      So far the biggest issue I have had with Phase 0 is my time management.  I have been practicing time-boxing but quite often I Ignore my timer and then burn myself out by becoming frustrated after not making any progress after, say, 2 hours.  The only action I can take is to be more strict on myself with the time-boxing I use.  Although, I did pair with someone after completing all the challenges just to give myself another point of view and practice my explanation skills (which are nearly non-existent).  Helping someone through challenges helped me quite a bit in understanding the best way to approach a problem, because I would actually have to explain my reasons to someone else rather than just doing whatever works.
      </p>

      <p>
      I am definitely branching out my mindset.  I refuse to 'give-up'.  I have been asking questions after about an hour of not being able to find the answer (which is a big improvement).  I also try to help as much as I can, but always checking with others to make sure no wrong information gets passed.  The way people approach a problem is always different, and I like being able to see how everyone does something because most likely, there is a way more efficient way.

  <h3>Hashes and Arrays with the 5th Element & Dinosaurs!</h3> <!-- title -->
  <h5>Technical Blog</h5> <!-- subtitle -->
  <h5>22 FEB 15 </h5> <!-- date -->
    <p>
    Arrays and Hashes are both 'collections' in Ruby.  They both store data/information that can then be accessed at any point, either as a whole object or individual aspects.  The main difference between the two is that an Array uses integers to index it's information while a Hash allows the use of any object type.

    <p>Array elements are indexed starting from 0.  The first element in an array is 0, then 1, 2, 3, and so on.  To access these elements, simply add block quotes and the element number after the array, For example:</p>

        <p class="code">my_array[4] # accesses element in position 4 (
        which would be the 5th element...in the array ;) )</p>

    <p>Elements can also be accessed from the end of an an array, starting at '-1' for the last element.</p>

        <p class="code">my_array["Triceratops", "Brachiosaurus", "Stegasaurus", "Velociraptor"]<br>
        my_array[-2] # accesses the 2nd element from the end of the array, which would be "Stegasaurus"</p>

    <p>Hashes store information with 'keys' that have an assigned value.  To access different keys in a Hash, simply call the hash with the key.</p>

        <p class="code">car = { <br>
            "color" => "white" <br>
            "style" => "coupe" <br>
            "drive" => "RWD" <br>
            "seats" => "4" <br>
            } <br>

        car["drive"] # accesses the value, "RWD", which is assigned to the key "drive"</p>

        <p>Both Arrays and Hashes store data.  Accessing and 'naming' the data varies.  With Arrays, accessing an element is as easy as calling the element number.  Data stored in arrays are quicker and more efficient to access.  Hashes have key names which makes accessing a 'specific' value easier by way of names, rather than just location.</p>

    <h3>Margin, Borders, and Padding with Castles</h3>
    <h5>Technical Blog</h5>
    <h5>15 FEB 15</h5>
      <p>
      Alright, one important aspect of spacing in CSS is understanding the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding.  These are all related to the 'box' of an object,how much space it takes up, and how things inside will be placed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Margin: The margin of an element is the distance outside that the element 'takes up'.  If you give a box a margin of 10px, then you are telling other objects that there is an extra 10px off of the border that is being used by the object.  Like an invisible force shield extending 10px off, that will prevent anything else (well, that can be bypassed) from getting closer. 
       margin (top, right, left, bottom): 10px;
       </p>
       <p>
      Border: The border is the last physical boundary. A border is set, and that determines the limits of an element.  It would be the outer walls of a building.  It's set, it's there, you can choose to display it. 
      border(top, right, bottom, left): 10px;
      </p>
      <p>

      Padding: The inner part of the border that determines how far away from the border, the items inside will actually be.  Set this to 10px and whatever is inside will have 10px of space between it and the border.
      padding (top, right, left, bottom): 10px;
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>Let's try this...</p>
      <p>
      Padding is the King inside the castle, sitting in his room.  Not moving, having every joy in the world.  The border is the Castle's outer walls; all that awesome stone.  The margin is the last farmland that belongs to the king before it turns into the evil kings' land...there is no real boundary line, but the evil king won't cross that land.
      </p>

      ^That helped me.

    <h3> Git Blogg'n</h3>
    <h5>Technical Blog</h5>
    <h5>08 FEB 15</h5>
   		<p>  These blogs will definitely be getting longer as more advanced topics come around.  Right now, this is just a simple overview of a few tools we will be using throughout our course.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	I will try to go in order here.  Basic command line commands is where it all started.  Simple navigation, creating/removing, copying/moving various items (directories and files).  The commands are pretty straight forward.  All it takes is using them over and over to really get everything down and memorized.  The only issue I have had is when moving/copying I sometimes cant find my file in the designated directory but when I go to delete the directory it says that it is not empty (though it appears empty).  I somehow make random Ghost Files that I can't see, but appear to exist when trying to rmdir (remove directory).
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	Next up, version control Git.  Version control is a wonderful idea.  It is probably the most important tool that we, as aspiring developers, have on our computers.  Version control allows all of our changes to be tracked and logged for reference.  As someone who likes to try out many approaches/solutions, this will make finding the best/most efficient one so much easier.  I can compare my 'old' code directly with changes I wish to implement and see if it is worth keeping.  Git logs all changes (that are added) so looking at previous/new code is super convenient.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	Now in order to make everything accessible remotely or to anyone else, it is all pushed to GitHub.  GitHub is basically the cloud for all code (and other files) we will be working on.  Loading everything to GitHub gives someone else access to my code and changes, and allows me to access my code from a different computer if needed and 'sync' it all together.  I am completely new to GitHub (well everything so far, really) so I still am getting used to the layout and navigation.  As far as I can tell, I have not had much trouble with using GitHub.  Pretty much push/pull to and from GitHub and everything should be up to date on both ends.

    <h3>Fireside Chat: Chef's Kitchen</h3>
    <h5>Cultural Blog</h5>
    <h5>08 FEB 15</h5>
      <p>
      As of right now, I have the impression that the DBC experience will be well balanced with hard, challenging, and even stressful work, and constant satisfaction with the improvements and knowledge that will be gained.  To me, that makes for a rewarding experience when everything is all said and done (well, I will never be 'done' with any of this... just my time at DBC).  I am looking forward to the challenges and complete change of pace from my 'usual' routine in life.  I'm already seeing how much dedication will be needed to succeed and have already made some changes in my personal time to make sure I am going in a full 100 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have already enjoyed just a few minutes of chat with various people in DBC and am excited to be going through DBC with everyone.  There are definitely going to be different approaches by everyone based off past experiences and career choices.  I find that fascinating and extremely helpful.  Engaging with people at DBC shouldn't be an issue at all.  Even with those who have no prior programming experience, I am looking forward to learning as much as I can from everyone.  I have always liked the culture and outcomes from this culture, I just have never been apart of it.
    </p>
    <p>
       This learning environment definitely has me both excited and nervous.  I like the environment of learning by hands on and daily engagements.  I guess the nervous part would be with the pace.  I just keep thinking that when it picks up, and more advanced topics are learned, if I don't understand something I will immediately start to fall behind.  But then that brings me back to the culture because I have already noticed how helpful people have been just in the first week of the course.  Others have already posted issues and someone has responded with a suggestion or solution almost immediately.  I just hope I will be able to give as much I am receiving from everyone else.
