      <p> Alright, how many people used that same title?</p>

      <p>
        So far all of my pair sessions have been great.  I always benefit from each partner and finish with useful ideas for individual coding.  Pairing is always fun and that really makes learning easier and rewarding.  It's nice to have someone either struggle with you or be able to help out instantly.

        One of the best parts about pairing is the feedback that is then received afterwards.  The feedback I have received has been extremely helpful and I have been keeping note of it during other pairings.  It's definitely nice to know how others feel about the session.

      <p>
        When giving feedback, the hardest thing for me is to find something I feel the other person needs to improve on.  Everyone has a different style, and it may work wonderfully for them and several other pairs, but maybe not so well with just one other individual.  So it's hard to determine if it was your pair doing something, or yourself that is just not used to that way/style.
