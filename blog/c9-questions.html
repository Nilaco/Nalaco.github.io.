    <h3>Who's The Question Master?</h3> <!--title -->

      <p>
        Asking a questions is just as important as finding the answer.  In order to ease the process of finding an answer and allowing others to supply correct answers, questions must be specific and easy to understand.
      </p>

      <p>
      So what makes up a good question? Specific, concise, single focused (break the question into multiple varied questions if possible), and at least some showing of effort that you tried to a decent amount to find the answer on your own (if possible).
      </p>

      <p>
      Lots of times, on various forums, when a question that is extremely vague, too open ended, or just way to easy too answer without outside help, others will either supply the incorrect answer (due to not understanding the question), or not even bother to answer the question (because questions are asked in order to learn something, but if no effort is put in to learn on your own, others aren't as eager/willing to help 'teach').
