        How does programming promote laziness? Looping! Using loops allows you to go over a section over a section code any number of times without having to retype it. The concept of looping is pretty much the same, however the syntax differs between Ruby and Javascript (if you want it to). There are multiple types of loops to use, the most common are as follows:
      </p>

      <p>
      For Loops: Loop through the code block once every time an element in the expression is reached.  For example: <p class = "code_r">for i in 0..10</p>(Ruby) will run the code every for every element in 0..10, which will temporarily be assigned to "i". The result would be every number from 0..10.  In Javascript the loop functions the same way, however, initialing can be seen as <p class = "code_js">for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++)</p>(JS).  In JS, all the parameters can be defined in the initial statement.  i = 0, sets the starting counter.  i <= 10, when this is met, the looping ends. i++, after every run of code, add 1 to the initial counter.
      </p>

      <p>
      While Loops: Loop through the code block WHILE the condition is TRUE.  While loops will continually go through whatever code is held within, until the initializing expression becomes false. <p class = "code_r"> while survived = false </p> will run the loop as long as survived stays false.  As soon as survived becomes true, the code will not run.  JS also checks while loops the same while <p class = "code_js"> while (i < 15) </p>.  With the both examples, you need to make sure that there is something in the code that will eventually change the initial expression to FALSE.  Otherwise the while loop will never end.  Which is not a good thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ruby also has an 'until' loop which is pretty much the opposite of while.  It will loop through the code while the expression is false, or UNTIL the expression is TRUE.
