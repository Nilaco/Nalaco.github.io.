    <h3>StereoType Threat</h3> <!--title -->

      <p>
        What is Stereotype Threat? It's when someone's behavior alters because of negative stereotypes from those around.  Basically, you subconsciously fulfill stereotypes because of what is 'expected.' If you ever were embarrassed or ashamed to do something just because of how others would perceive it, you have experienced stereotype threat.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can see based off the various studies (Supplied by a simple Google search,) how stereotype threat affects individuals.  It can significantly affect someones performance.  Not doing something for fear of being judged by another should never be an excuse, regardless of if you are subconsciously avoiding it.  Stereotypes are just that, stereotypes, but unfortunately they still hit individuals with force.
      </p>

      <p>
      I cannot recall any moments where I have felt a stereotype threat nor can I recall a time where I noticed or felt someone else was experiencing this.  It's as simple as not judging people before knowing them, and not judging yourself because of others.  Rather than comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to you X years ago.  Problem solved. Judge yourself based on progression rather than the thoughts of others.  With that, you won't alter your behavior due to others' perceptions.
