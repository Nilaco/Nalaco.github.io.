    <h3>Technological Dependence</h3> <!--title -->
    <h5>Cultural Blog</h5> <!--subtitle -->

      <p>
        Rather than focusing on a problem IN the Tech World, I decided to focus on a problem caused BY the Tech World.
      </p>

        <p>
          Relying on technology to do basic tasks is taking away from our fundamental skills.  Every day, something is becoming easier to access or do, and with that, human skills start to deteriorate.
        </p>

        <p> 
          Social interactions become more apparent and awkward because you can no longer keep your head down and play your favorite mobile game or message with your "real" friends.  People feel disconnected from others without technology, rather than feeling connected to the immediate world in which they are presently active in.  Communicating with other people is a basic human skill which is slowly slipping away.  Interacting with people you aren't acquainted to is now frowned upon as annoyance (even just sitting next to someone on public transportation is becoming "awkward"). I have had countless times where, either waiting for an appointment or being one of 2 people at,say,  a park, where I have tried to have a face to face conversation with someone I don't know and they just keep going back to their device to play that game or update their social media status. Even with people I frequently interact with, I find it extremely disconnecting (and rude) to be attached to a device while out enjoying each others company.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not just immediate (presence) communication between others is being effected by technology. Less and less people can read a .map/use simple navigation (yep, just referenced this weeks tech blog--anyone else pull that off?), memorize basic information, or even do simple math.  One device can easily do all of those for us.  That may be super convenient (and it is), but for the moments where that little tech gadget is unaccessible, people become lost.  What happens when your lost? You become frightened and unfamiliar with everything around you.
         </p>

        <p>
          So what about all this?  Why should you care about someone who is not in your "friends" group? I can't answer that for anyone.  You choose how you want to deal with people, but if someone is reaching out in the now unconventional way of random social communication, what do you lose by entertaining a friendly interaction for a few moments before deciding to tune out everything around you.  If there is too much of a dependence on technology, people lose dependence for one another.
