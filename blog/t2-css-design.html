      Alright, one important aspect of spacing in CSS is understanding the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding.  These are all related to the 'box' of an object,how much space it takes up, and how things inside will be placed.

      Margin: The margin of an element is the distance outside that the element 'takes up'.  If you give a box a margin of 10px, then you are telling other objects that there is an extra 10px off of the border that is being used by the object.  Like an invisible force shield extending 10px off, that will prevent anything else (well, that can be bypassed) from getting closer. 
      margin (top, right, left, bottom): 10px;

      Border: The border is the last physical boundary. A border is set, and that determines the limits of an element.  It would be the outer walls of a building.  It's set, it's there, you can choose to display it. 
      border(top, right, bottom, left): 10px;

      Padding: The inner part of the border that determines how far away from the border, the items inside will actually be.  Set this to 10px and whatever is inside will have 10px of space between it and the border.
      padding (top, right, left, bottom): 10px;

      Let's try this...

      Padding is the King inside the castle, sitting in his room.  Not moving, having every joy in the world.  The border is the Castle's outer walls; all that awesome stone.  The margin is the last farmland that belongs to the king before it turns into the evil kings' land...there is no real boundary line, but the evil king won't cross that land.

      ^That helped me.

        I have already enjoyed just a few minutes of chat with various people in DBC and am excited to be going through DBC with everyone.  There are definitely going to be different approaches by everyone based off past experiences and career choices.  I find that fascinating and extremely helpful.  Engaging with people at DBC shouldn't be an issue at all.  Even with those who have no prior programming experience, I am looking forward to learning as much as I can from everyone.  I have always liked the culture and outcomes from this culture, I just have never been apart of it.

       This learning environment definitely has me both excited and nervous.  I like the environment of learning by hands on and daily engagements.  I guess the nervous part would be with the pace.  I just keep thinking that when it picks up, and more advanced topics are learned, if I don't understand something I will immediately start to fall behind.  But then that brings me back to the culture because I have already noticed how helpful people have been just in the first week of the course.  Others have already posted issues and someone has responded with a suggestion or solution almost immediately.  I just hope I will be able to give as much I am receiving from everyone else.
