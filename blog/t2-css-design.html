      Alright, one important aspect of spacing in CSS is understanding the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding.  These are all related to the 'box' of an object,how much space it takes up, and how things inside will be placed.
      </p>

      <p>
      Margin: The margin of an element is the distance outside that the element 'takes up'.  If you give a box a margin of 10px, then you are telling other objects that there is an extra 10px off of the border that is being used by the object.  Like an invisible force shield extending 10px off, that will prevent anything else (well, that can be bypassed) from getting closer. 
      margin (top, right, left, bottom): 10px;
      </p>

      <p>
      Border: The border is the last physical boundary. A border is set, and that determines the limits of an element.  It would be the outer walls of a building.  It's set, it's there, you can choose to display it. 
      border(top, right, bottom, left): 10px;
      </p>

      <p>
      Padding: The inner part of the border that determines how far away from the border, the items inside will actually be.  Set this to 10px and whatever is inside will have 10px of space between it and the border.
      padding (top, right, left, bottom): 10px;
      </p>

      <br>
      Let's try this...
      <p>
      Padding is the King inside the castle, sitting in his room.  Not moving, having every joy in the world.  The border is the Castle's outer walls; all that awesome stone.  The margin is the last farmland that belongs to the king before it turns into the evil kings' land...there is no real boundary line, but the evil king won't cross that land.
      </p>

      ^That helped me.
