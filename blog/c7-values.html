        Enthusiasm!!!! Wooooo, Yayyyyyy!
      </p>

      <p>
        Enthusiasm is superly duperly super duper important, no matter what you are doing.  Cleaning up that wine stain on the carpet won't be boring and stressful if you are enthusiastic about it.  Own that carpet! Destroy that stain and triumph with a fresh and clean floor for your feet to comfortably rest upon.  Seriously tho, if you are enthusiastic while doing any task/learning, you won't even consider being bored and wasting time.  You are way more eager to learn and pay attention.  Eager + Fun + Learning = Awesome Knowledge Retention (based on a Personal Study on Myself).

        So, what was the last thing someone asked me for advice on? What to get for dinner, and I said Chinese.  Does that relate to my enthusiasm value above? HELL YA IT DOES.  I haven't had Chinese food (frozen doesn't count) in over 9 months so I was SUPER EXCITED about this.  And guess what?? Chinese was consumed shortly after. WIN WIN.

        Can my values help mediate stereotype threat? THEY SURE CAN.  Allow me to tell ya...When you are having fun and are just a massive bundle of excitement, you don't givva a (insert appropriate word) what others think about you because you are too busy enjoying yourself.  Think those people are going to make fun of you for those AWESOME new Pokemon Velcro shoes that light up when you walk? Not if you wear them like they are the COOLEST and FUNNEST (inset appropriate phrase) things on this planet.  Rock them Pokemon shoes.
