      <p>
        A variables scope is where that variable will be accessible within a program.  By setting the scope of a variable, it can be accessed from other areas or levels in code.  There are several different variable scopes with Ruby: Global, Constant, Class, Instance, Local.
      </p>

      <p>
        A global variable is distinguished by a $ in front: $global.  Globals are set in order to have access to the variable anywhere in a program.  Using a global variable is risky, as it can be altered from anywhere as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Constant variables begin with a capital letter and after they are given a value, should not be altered.  Constants are accessible anywhere within a class.  If a constant is declared outside of a class, it has the same scope as a global variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class variables are declared by using @@ in front of the name.  These variables are declared in a class, and then are accessible by any instance of that class.  The class variable can be changed in other instances, and effects all instances of the class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instance variables are pretty similar to class variables.  Declared with a single @, instance variables are unique to their specific instance  of a class.  Changes are not spread amongst all instances of a class
      </p>

      <p>
      The most basic, local variables.  Local variables are assigned without anything in front of them.  Accessible only within the code where they rest.  If a local variable is declared within a loop, that is the only place it can be accessed.
