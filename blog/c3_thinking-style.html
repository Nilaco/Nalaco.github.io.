    <h3>Learning to Think?</h3> <!--title -->

      Based off the Gregorc Thinking Style Quiz, I am a Concrete Sequential Thinker.  I learn best from starting at the bottom, and getting comfortable with every step before moving on to the next one.  There has to be some format, or order, for me to look back on to really see my own progress.  Though I tend to give in to unstructured learning quite a bit because of the 'new' factor.  I like to learn by doing, and having hands-on at the same moment in order to better understand what parts I am still not getting.

      So far the biggest issue I have had with Phase 0 is my time management.  I have been practicing time-boxing but quite often I Ignore my timer and then burn myself out by becoming frustrated after not making any progress after, say, 2 hours.  The only action I can take is to be more strict on myself with the time-boxing I use.  Although, I did pair with someone after completing all the challenges just to give myself another point of view and practice my explanation skills (which are nearly non-existent).  Helping someone through challenges helped me quite a bit in understanding the best way to approach a problem, because I would actually have to explain my reasons to someone else rather than just doing whatever works.

      I am definitely branching out my mindset.  I refuse to 'give-up'.  I have been asking questions after about an hour of not being able to find the answer (which is a big improvement).  I also try to help as much as I can, but always checking with others to make sure no wrong information gets passed.  The way people approach a problem is always different, and I like being able to see how everyone does something because most likely, there is a way more efficient way.
