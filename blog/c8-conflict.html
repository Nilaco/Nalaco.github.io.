      Conflict and Emotion.  I don't have anything witty to say about this so here we go with the questions for this blog... 
      </p>

      <p><pre>
        1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
        2. What was the source of the conflict?
        3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
        4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
        5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
        6. What did you learn from this experience?
      </pre></p>

      <p>
        This is probably a petty issue compared to what could have been on here, but it's a fun one and will definitely be a warning to others ;)
      </p>

      1: Keeping it short.  My (older) brother took my car (when he has his own) without me knowing.  My car was gone for a couple hours, and when he returned he said he was just taking his friend home.  Well, I doubted his statement and went to investigate! Through my (installed for this very reason), 'on-board' monitoring devices I placed in my vehicle, I was able to determine a portion of the adventure my car had gone on.  Basically, he took my car, picked someone up, went on a 'date', and then halfway through said 'date' disabled my monitoring device.  There have also been occasions where his friends have mentioned something about my car (that would only make sense if you have driven it, which means he lets other people take my car out? WTF, bro come on). That pissed me off for multiple reasons.
      </p>

      <p>
      2: Clearly my big bro was the source.
      </p>

      <p>
      3: I was pretty pissed.  I don't trust people who just take/use (expensive) things without telling me first.  
      </p>

      <p>
      4: I installed additional monitoring devices that I did not tell anyone else about =).  I started keeping my keys in my room instead of the 'key drawer', and I told him to be courteous of my stuff, because when I put time, money, and effort into something I take extreme care of, I'm not gonna trust anyone else with it before they can show they are responsible (<---keyword) and just 'ask' to use it. /rant 
      </p>

      <p>
      5: No idea.
      </p>

      <p>
      6: If you are paranoid and value stuff, don't let it be easily accessible by others.  TRUTH.
