      As of right now, I have the impression that the DBC experience will be well balanced with hard, challenging, and even stressful work, and constant satisfaction with the improvements and knowledge that will be gained.  To me, that makes for a rewarding experience when everything is all said and done (well, I will never be 'done' with any of this... just my time at DBC).  I am looking forward to the challenges and complete change of pace from my 'usual' routine in life.  I'm already seeing how much dedication will be needed to succeed and have already made some changes in my personal time to make sure I am going in a full 100 percent.

        I have already enjoyed just a few minutes of chat with various people in DBC and am excited to be going through DBC with everyone.  There are definitely going to be different approaches by everyone based off past experiences and career choices.  I find that fascinating and extremely helpful.  Engaging with people at DBC shouldn't be an issue at all.  Even with those who have no prior programming experience, I am looking forward to learning as much as I can from everyone.  I have always liked the culture and outcomes from this culture, I just have never been apart of it.

       This learning environment definitely has me both excited and nervous.  I like the environment of learning by hands on and daily engagements.  I guess the nervous part would be with the pace.  I just keep thinking that when it picks up, and more advanced topics are learned, if I don't understand something I will immediately start to fall behind.  But then that brings me back to the culture because I have already noticed how helpful people have been just in the first week of the course.  Others have already posted issues and someone has responded with a suggestion or solution almost immediately.  I just hope I will be able to give as much I am receiving from everyone else.
