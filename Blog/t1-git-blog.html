      I will try to go in order here.  Basic command line commands is where it all started.  Simple navigation, creating/removing, copying/moving various items (direcotries and files).  The commands are pretty straight forward.  All it takes is using them over and over to really get everything down and memorized.  The only issue I have had is when moving/copying I sometimes cant find my file in the designated directory but when I go to delete the directory it says that it is not empty (though it appears empty).  I somehow make random Ghost Files that I can't see, but appear to exist when trying to rmdir (remove directory).

        Next up, version control Git.  Version control is a wonderful idea.  It is probably the most important tool that we, as aspiring developers, have on our computers.  Version control allows all of our changes to be tracked and logged for reference.  As someone who likes to try out many approaches/solutions, this will make finding the best/most efficient one so much easier.  I can compare my 'old' code directly with changes I wish to implement and see if it is worth keeping.  Git logs all changes (that are added) so looking at previous/new code is super convinient.

        Now in order to make everything accessible remotely or to anyone else, it is all pushed to GitHub.  GitHub is basically the cloud for all code (and other files) we will be working on.  Loading everything to GitHub gives someone else access to my code and changes, and allows me to access my code from a different computer if needed and 'sync' it all together.  I am completely new to GitHub (well everything so far, really) so I still am getting used to the layout and navigation.  As far as I can tell, I have not had much trouble with using GitHub.  Pretty much push/pull to and from GitHub and everything should be up to date on both ends.
